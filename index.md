# Introduction
Hi, my name is Tianyang and I'm currently a third-year student at the University of Adelaide, studying for a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by technology and its limitless potential to change the world. As I've grown older, this fascination has only grown, leading me to pursue a career in computer science.

My interests within computer science are diverse, but I'm particularly passionate about computer systems, computer architecture, and computer networks. I love learning about how computers work at a fundamental level, and how they can be optimized for maximum performance and efficiency. Understanding the underlying hardware and software of computers is essential for building powerful, scalable systems that can solve complex problems.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with hardware and software, building and configuring custom computer systems, and experimenting with new technologies. I'm also an avid reader of tech blogs and forums, always on the lookout for new ideas and emerging trends in the field of computer science.

I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as a computer science student, and I'm looking forward to applying my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world.
